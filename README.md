### OOP Principle
I have tried to implement tree OOP principle in the `pizza-shop` project
- Program to the Interface, not to the Implementation
- Encapsulate what varries
- Favor Composition over Inheritance (HAS-A is better than IS-A)

##### Project summary
Imagine a Pizza shop where you can order your favorite pizza
- You can choose your crust, Thick or Thin
- You can add your favorite toppings
- You will get free items if available (example: Add Thick crust to get Pepperoni for free)
